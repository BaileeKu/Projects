# Bailee Ku's Projects
This repository will serve as a living portfolio with projects from my engineering coursework at Florida State. Below are short descriptions of these projects.

## Spray Bottle 3D CAD Drawing Package
Capstone project for my ME Tools Lab course. I selected an object with at least 7 distinct parts and 1 helical sweep to model and create a drawing package. 

## Stirling Engine 3D CAD Drawing Package
First CAD project for my ME Tools Lab course. I modeled a Stirling engine based off of engineering drawings provided by my instructor to familiarize myself with Creo Parametric.
